A jQuery slideshow with a responsive layout, easy to use with an extended admin panel

== Description ==

If you're looking for an advanced Wordpress slideshow: [**Shortcodelic plugin bundle**](http://codecanyon.net/item/shortcodelic-wordpress-plugin-bundle/6076939?ref=pixedelic "Shortcodelic plugin bundle") (it also includes many other features: tabs, accordions, Google maps, pricing table, a page composer…).

A jQuery slideshow with an adaptive/responsive layout, easy to use with an extended admin panel. It already provides ColorBox, TimThumb, many effects. You can include it into your theme by using the shortcode (through a useful TinyMCE custom button) or through a meta-box by adding some lines of code to your theme.

Here is the demo page: [Camera slideshow](http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/wp.php "Camera slideshow")

== Installation ==

1. Upload `camera` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can include Camera slideshow into your projects by using the TinyMCE custom button, by using the shortcode [camera slideshow='my-first-slideshow'] or by enabling the meta-box. In this case add these lines to your function.php file:
if (function_exists('camera_main_ss_add')) {
    add_action('admin_init','camera_main_ss_add');
}
A meta box will be available on your page/posts backend to select the slideshow you prefer. Just put this code into your loop to display the slideshow:
if (function_exists('camera_meta_slideshow')) {
    $meta_camera = get_post_custom( $post->ID );
    if(isset($meta_camera['camera_meta_slideshow'])){
        echo camera_meta_slideshow($meta_camera['camera_meta_slideshow'][0]);
    }
}
